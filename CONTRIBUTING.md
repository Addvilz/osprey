# Contributing to Osprey

We are glad that you decided to invest your effort in Osprey. There are a few things you should consider:

1. All contributions are welcome - big or small.
2. It's okay if you do not know how to do something. We all don't know how to do something, and we all make mistakes.
3. If the change you are considering could be described as major, please, open an discussion about it first in the issue
 tracker. We don't want you to spend a lot of time on something we might not want to be included in the Osprey in the first place.
4. Write tests, if you can (at the time of this writing, we don't have any yet. But we will be using JUnit 4).
5. Don't be excessively rude or condescending in pull request or issue debates. We are all passionate about what we do,
 but let's keep it tasteful.
6. Commit messages should be meaningful.
7. All changes and features you submit shall be submitted under projects license - Apache License v2.0.
